This plugin will hold various tools I can think of for dealing with coffeescript. For now, there are two of these:

  - A "live preview" feature that's a bit different from the one in the official [coffeescript runtime files](https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script).
  - A "delete and dedent" mapping to help with a use case I've encountered a couple of times.

Since it's a work in progress, it's not published on vim.org and has no documentation for now. The latter will probably be adressed soonish. If you feel like using it, and you encounter any problems, please open an issue on github's bugtracker.
